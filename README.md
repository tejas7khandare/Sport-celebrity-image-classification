# Sport Celebrity Image Classification

## Overview
This project aims to classify sport celebrities based on their images using machine learning techniques. The process involves data collection through web scraping, preprocessing steps including face and eye detection, feature extraction using wavelet transform, model training, and optimization.

## Project Components

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
   - **Data Collection:** Utilized web scraping techniques to gather image data of sport celebrities.
   - **Preprocessing:** Employed NumPy, Pandas, and OpenCV for efficient data manipulation and face-eye detection.

### 2. Feature Extraction and Preprocessing 2
   - **Feature Extraction:** Implemented wavelet transform to extract relevant features from the images.
   - **Preprocessing 2:** Utilized the extracted features to enhance the model's ability to discern key patterns.

### 3. Model Training and Optimization
   - **Model Selection:** Employed various machine learning models such as SVM, Random Forest, etc.
   - **Optimization:** Conducted grid search cross-validation to identify the optimal model and tune its parameters.
   - **Achievement:** Achieved a high accuracy of approximately 85%, showcasing the effectiveness of the selected model and its tuned parameters.
